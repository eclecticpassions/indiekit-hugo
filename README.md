## Notes on Set Up

- Hosting Indiekit on Render.com (free tier)
- Separate stores:
  - Media store — S3 object bucket
  - Content store — Git repo
- Media served via [Bunny CDN](https://bunny.net/?ref=k4vc3x5108)[^1]
  - Origin: S3 bucket
  - Edge rule: "override origin url"
  - Workflow: Hugo front matter (Indiekit image link) -> Bunny CDN link -> S3 bucket link -> 🖼️

[^1]: This is an affiliate link. I'm a big fan of Bunny.net, I use Bunny Storage for all my static hosting needs and Bunny CDN to great effect. I've written about them [on my blog](https://burgeonlab.com/support/#bunnynet) if you're interested in trying them with your static website or migrating from GitHub Pages.
